Password Generator

Description: 

I was tasked with creating a password generator that when prompted, could produce a password for the user based 
on a few select limiters.  To do this I created a javascript function that could auto-generate a password at anywhere 
from 8 to 128 characters, with preferences for uppercase, lowercase and numbers.  The javascript was divided between
two parts, a function that generated the password prompts, and a few if statements for getting the passwords right.
